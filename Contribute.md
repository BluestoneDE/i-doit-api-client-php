#   Contribution

Thank you very much for your interest in this project! There are plenty of ways you can support us. :-)


##  Code of Conduct

We like you to read and follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing. Thank you.


##  Use it

The best and (probably) easiest way is to use the API client library for your own projects. It would be very nice to share your thoughts with us. We love to hear from you.

If you have questions how to use it properly read the [documentation](README.md) carefully.


##  Report bugs

If you find something strange please report it to [our issue tracker](https://github.com/bheisig/i-doit-api-client-php/issues).


##  Make a wish

Of course, there are some features in the pipeline. However, if you have good ideas how to improve the API client library please let us know! Write a feature request [in our issue tracker](https://github.com/bheisig/i-doit-cli/issues).


##  Setup a development environment

If you like to contribute source code, documentation snippets, self-explaining examples or other useful bits, fork this repository, setup the environment and make a pull request.

~~~ {.bash}
git clone https://github.com/bheisig/i-doit-api-client-php.git
~~~

If you have a GitHub account create a fork first and then clone the repository.

After that, setup the environment with Composer:

~~~ {.bash}

##  Requirements

Developers must meet some more requirements:

*   [PHP](https://php.net/), version 5.6+ (7.1 recommended)
*   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
*   One or more working copies of [i-doit](https://i-doit.com/) (otherwise this API client library is senseless)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)


##  Run unit tests

Unit tests are located under `tests/`. Just call `composer phpunit` to execute all of them.


##  Release new version

â€¦ and publish it to [packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/bheisig/idoitapi). You need commit rights for this repository.

*   Bump version in [`composer.json`](composer.json)
*   Update [`README.md`](README.md) and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)
*   Commit changes

    `git commit CHANGELOG.md composer.json README.md -m "Prepare release of version <VERSION>"`
*   Create a tag with

    `git tag -s -m "Release version <VERSION>" <VERSION>`

    `git push --tags`

There is already a webhook enabled to push the code from GitHub to packagist.
